I spent a lot of time traveling during 2012 and 2013, mostly in Europe. That time I just watched the movie *Die Nordwand*. The scene that Toni Kurz said "Ich kann nicht mehr" and died right in front of the rescure team, after long struggling of the whole night, touched me so deeply. I became so obssessed with mountaineer stories. The Alps certainly means a lot for me. 

I went to Zermatt to visit Matterhorn. Despite several possibilities, I always use the Gonergrath Train. It provides the perfect confront to Matterhorn, not too close or too far, surrounded by snow mountains in all charateristics.

When I was just sitting there to enjoy the unspeakable moment to myself, a guy suddenly started talking to me. "She is beatiful", that was the start of our conversitaion. As the chatting went on, he told me that he was an mountaineer. During his youth, he spent considerably long time in Tibet, exploring the Himalaya. 

I asked whether he have peaked Matterhorn. As a Swiss, it seamed the first thing to do as a alpenist. He smiled, "Maybe in next life". The conversation happened in 2012, when he was in his fifties. :smile: <br />
For most of us, those prestigious mountains are only to be worshiped. Not in this life, not in next life, would we ever dream to step on the peak. Yet they are still a personal inspiration for me.
