This file is created to showcase different formatting syntax for later reference. 


## 1. heading 
## level 2
### heading level 3
#### heading level 4

## 2. this is to start a new paragraph, add a blank line in between
I really like using Markdown. 

I think I will use it to format all of my documents from now on. 

## 3. this is to break the line.  
*in markdown preview it works, but in theme preview it doesn not. Basically this theme does not render html formatting*

this is the first line <br />
and this is the second line <br />

## 4. what is a blockquotes?
> Dorothy followed her through many rooms in her castle
>
> But she said 
>> don't worry. you are in safe hand

 
 ## 5. try list

### ordered list and unorderded list

1. first item
2. second item
3. third item
   1. good stuff
   2. oh no
4. fourth item
   - point
     - something else

## 6. code blocks
1.  Open the file.
2.  Find the following code block on line 21:

        <html>

3.  Update the title to match the name of your website.
